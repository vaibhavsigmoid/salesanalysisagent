Here's the complete ETL pipeline code for processing the cleaned sales data:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv("path_to_sales_data.csv")

# Ensure correct data types
df['product_id'] = df['product_id'].astype(str)
df['price'] = df['price'].astype(float)

# Remove any remaining duplicates
df = df.drop_duplicates()

# Example transformations
# 1. Calculate total sales
df['total_sales'] = df.groupby('product_id')['price'].transform('sum')

# 2. Categorize products based on price
def categorize_price(price):
    if price < 15:
        return 'Low'
    elif 15 <= price < 25:
        return 'Medium'
    else:
        return 'High'

df['price_category'] = df['price'].apply(categorize_price)

# 3. Create a unique identifier
df['unique_id'] = df.index + 1

# 4. Calculate price difference from mean
mean_price = df['price'].mean()
df['price_diff_from_mean'] = df['price'] - mean_price

# Save the processed data
df.to_csv("processed_sales_data.csv", index=False)

# Print summary statistics
print(df.describe())

# Print the first few rows of the processed data
print(df.head())
```

This ETL pipeline does the following:

1. Loads the data from a CSV file (you should replace "path_to_sales_data.csv" with the actual path to your input file).
2. Ensures correct data types for 'product_id' (string) and 'price' (float).
3. Removes any remaining duplicates, although we didn't find any in our validation step.
4. Performs several example transformations:
   - Calculates total sales for each product.
   - Categorizes products based on their price.
   - Creates a unique identifier for each row.
   - Calculates the price difference from the mean price.
5. Saves the processed data to a new CSV file named "processed_sales_data.csv".
6. Prints summary statistics and the first few rows of the processed data for quick verification.

This script provides a comprehensive ETL pipeline that cleans, transforms, and enriches the sales data. It's ready to be executed and will generate a new CSV file with the processed data, which can be used for further analysis or loaded into a database.
# Output from data_loader_task (Data Loader and File Type Inspector)
The file "/Users/vaibhavgupta/Desktop/crewAI/salesanalysisagent/src/salesanalysisagent/data/schema_change/sales.txt" could not be loaded because it has an unsupported file type (.txt). The DataLoaderTool only supports CSV, Parquet, and Excel file formats.

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:

1. Check if the file is actually in one of the supported formats but incorrectly named. If so, rename it with the appropriate extension (.csv, .parquet, or .xlsx).

2. If the file is indeed a text file containing structured data (like CSV), you may need to modify the DataLoaderTool to handle .txt files as CSV. This would involve adding a specific condition to treat .txt files as CSV in the tool's implementation.

3. Convert the .txt file to one of the supported formats (preferably CSV if it contains tabular data) before attempting to load it.

4. If the file contains unstructured text data, you may need to implement a different approach for reading and processing the file, which is outside the scope of the current DataLoaderTool.

Since we cannot load the file into a DataFrame due to the unsupported format, no pandas ingestion code can be generated at this time. The file format needs to be addressed before proceeding with data loading and analysis.

# Output from inspect_task (Data Inspector)
Preview of the first few rows:
  product_id  product_desc  price
0          1           aaa   10.0
1          2           bbb   30.0
2          3           ccc   20.0
3         3A           yyy   20.0
4         3B           zzz   20.0

Schema information:
{'product_id': 'object', ' product_desc': 'object', 'price': 'float64'}

The file contains structured data with three columns: product_id, product_desc, and price. The product_id and product_desc columns are of type 'object' (which typically represents string data in pandas), while the price column is of type 'float64' (64-bit floating-point numbers). 

Despite having a .txt extension, the file appears to be formatted as a CSV file. For future analysis, it might be beneficial to rename the file with a .csv extension or modify the data loading tool to recognize .txt files with this structure as CSV files.

# Output from schema_mapping_task (Schema Mapper)
Here is the dataframe with a unified schema:

  product_id  price
0          1   10.0
1          2   30.0
2          3   20.0
3         3A   20.0
4         3B   20.0

This dataframe represents the sales data with a standardized schema. It contains two columns:
1. 'product_id': This column contains the unique identifier for each product. It includes both numeric and alphanumeric identifiers.
2. 'price': This column contains the price of each product as a floating-point number.

The original 'product_desc' column has been removed in the unified schema, likely because it's not considered a core attribute in the standardized sales data format. This unified schema allows for consistent analysis and comparison across different sales datasets, focusing on the essential elements of product identification and pricing.

# Output from schema_validator_task (Schema validator)
Based on the schema validation results, we need to make the following changes:

1. Add a new column 'price' to the target table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE sales_table
ADD COLUMN price FLOAT;
```

2. Remove the 'Unnamed: 2' column from the target table (if it's not needed):

```sql
ALTER TABLE sales_table
DROP COLUMN "Unnamed: 2";
```

3. Address the type mismatch for the 'product_id' column. Since the source has it as 'object' (string) and the target has it as 'int64', we need to modify the target column to accept string values:

```sql
ALTER TABLE sales_table
ALTER COLUMN product_id TYPE VARCHAR(255);
```

4. Create a Python function to cast the 'product_id' column to the appropriate type when loading data:

```python
import pandas as pd

def cast_product_id(df):
    """
    Cast the product_id column to string (object) type.
    
    Args:
    df (pandas.DataFrame): The input DataFrame containing the sales data.
    
    Returns:
    pandas.DataFrame: The DataFrame with product_id cast to string type.
    """
    df['product_id'] = df['product_id'].astype(str)
    return df

# Example usage:
# df = pd.read_csv('sales.txt')
# df = cast_product_id(df)
# Now df is ready to be inserted into the database
```

These changes will ensure that the source data can be properly loaded into the target table. The SQL statements will modify the target table structure to match the source schema, and the Python function will handle the type casting of the 'product_id' column when loading data.

Remember to execute these SQL statements in your database management system and incorporate the Python function into your data loading process. Always test these changes in a non-production environment before applying them to your live database.

# Output from data_format_check_task (Data Format Change Detector)
To fix the data format change and ensure that the new data can be appended to the existing table without dropping any data, we need to create a Python function `fix_data_format_change` that will parse and convert the source data to match the target format. Here's the implementation:

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

def fix_data_format_change(source_df):
    # Make a copy of the source dataframe to avoid modifying the original
    df = source_df.copy()
    
    # Convert product_id to string to accommodate alphanumeric values
    df['product_id'] = df['product_id'].astype(str)
    
    # Format price as string with dollar sign and two decimal places
    df['price'] = df['price'].apply(lambda x: f'${x:.2f}')
    
    # Add a date column with the current date
    current_date = datetime.now().strftime('%m-%d-%Y')
    df['date'] = current_date
    
    # Reorder columns to match the target format
    df = df[['product_id', 'product_desc', 'price', 'date']]
    
    return df

# Example usage:
# source_data = pd.read_csv('/Users/vaibhavgupta/Desktop/crewAI/salesanalysisagent/src/salesanalysisagent/data/schema_change/sales.txt')
# converted_data = fix_data_format_change(source_data)
# converted_data.to_sql('existing_table', connection, if_exists='append', index=False)
```

This function does the following:

1. Creates a copy of the source dataframe to avoid modifying the original data.
2. Converts the `product_id` column to string type to accommodate alphanumeric values.
3. Formats the `price` column as a string with a dollar sign and two decimal places.
4. Adds a new `date` column with the current date (you may want to adjust this if the source data should have specific dates).
5. Reorders the columns to match the target format.

To use this function:

1. Load your source data into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Pass the DataFrame to the `fix_data_format_change` function.
3. The function will return a new DataFrame with the corrected format.
4. You can then append this corrected DataFrame to your existing table using pandas' `to_sql` method or any other database insertion method you prefer.

This solution ensures that:
- All new data from the source file can be appended to the table.
- The data format matches the existing table structure.
- No data in the existing table is dropped or modified.

Remember to handle any database-specific requirements, such as setting up the appropriate connection and using the correct data types for your specific database system.

# Output from clean_validate_task (Data Cleaner and Validator)
Here is the cleaned and validated dataframe:

   product_id  price
0           1   10.0
1           2   30.0
2           3   20.0
3          3A   20.0
4          3B   20.0

The dataframe has been processed as follows:
1. The unnecessary index column was removed.
2. The product_id column was converted to string type to accommodate alphanumeric values.
3. The price column was verified to contain only numeric values.
4. No missing values were found in the dataframe.
5. No duplicate entries were detected.

This cleaned and validated dataframe is now ready for further analysis or processing. The data quality has been ensured, with proper typing of columns and removal of any potential issues like unnecessary indexing or duplicate entries.
