Based on the schema validation results, here are the suggested code changes:

1. SQL code to add the new 'price' column to the target table:

```sql
-- Add new 'price' column to the target table
ALTER TABLE sales_table
ADD COLUMN price FLOAT;
```

2. SQL code to remove the 'Unnamed: 2' column from the target table (assuming it's not needed):

```sql
-- Remove the 'Unnamed: 2' column from the target table
ALTER TABLE sales_table
DROP COLUMN "Unnamed: 2";
```

3. Python function to cast the 'product_id' column type:

```python
import pandas as pd

def cast_product_id(df):
    """
    Cast the 'product_id' column to string (object) type.
    
    Args:
    df (pandas.DataFrame): Input dataframe containing the 'product_id' column.
    
    Returns:
    pandas.DataFrame: Dataframe with 'product_id' column cast to string type.
    """
    # Cast 'product_id' to string (object) type
    df['product_id'] = df['product_id'].astype(str)
    return df

# Example usage:
# df = pd.read_csv('your_source_file.csv')
# df = cast_product_id(df)
# Now you can proceed with loading the data into the target table
```

Explanation of the changes:

1. We add the 'price' column to the target table using SQL ALTER TABLE statement. This column exists in the source but not in the target.

2. We remove the 'Unnamed: 2' column from the target table, as it exists in the target but not in the source. This assumes that this column is not needed and was possibly an artifact of previous data loading.

3. We create a Python function to cast the 'product_id' column to string (object) type. This is necessary because the source has 'product_id' as 'object' type, while the target has it as 'int64'. Since the source contains alphanumeric values (e.g., '3A', '3B'), it's safer to cast the target column to string rather than trying to convert the source to integer.

After applying these changes, the schemas should be compatible, allowing for smooth data transfer from the source to the target table.
